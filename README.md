# Vainglory University

## Purpose

This project creates a website that analyzes Vainglory matches.  It
compares how a player did against archived data from other players in the
same role and skill tier, and offers advice on how the player can do better.

To do so, it implements robot advice-givers, who take on the personae of the
various heroes in the game, and offer advice fitting to that hero.  (For
instance, cheery Petal gives encouraging advice, while dark Krul likes to
focus on your fatal errors.)

This may become an entry for
[the API Challenge](https://developer.vainglorygame.com/rules),
or it may not.  Let's see how far I get by the deadline...

## Plans

My plans for what to add next are [listed here](plans.md).

## Dislcaimer

This repository does not evidence good coding style.  It was done as a
sprint in about a week.  Some of it is ugly and could be done a lot more
robustly, readably, and maintainably if I had chosen to give it more time.
I didn't.
