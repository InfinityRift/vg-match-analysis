# Plans for the future of this project

Here's a list of things I'd like to add to this project.  I can't add any
more before
[the challenge deadline](https://developer.vainglorygame.com/rules),
but this is just thinking ahead in case I play with this project more after
the deadline.

## Quality of Life/UX Improvements

 * Create a new university on [Rate My
   Professors](http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/) and add all the faculty.
   Then add links from each of their output to go complain/brag about grades
   you got from them.
 * Add a link from the grading screen to ask for the faculty to grade your
   teammates and/or enemies in the same match.

## New professor: Lyra

 * Topic: Team composition and drafting
    * List all positive synergies in your team and counters against enemies
    * List all snyergies on enemy team and their counters to your team
 * New data required, which I just won't have time to get before the
   challenge ends:
    * A list of which heroes work well or poorly into which other heroes,
      and why
    * A list of which heroes synergize well or poorly with other heroes,
      and why.
 * So Lyra is on hold for now.

## Extend professors Petal and Krul with counterbuilding information

 * Or optionally make this an entirely new professor
 * New routine needed:  Whether or not you counterbuilt
 * New routine needed:  Whether or not counterbuilding was even necessary
 * New routine needed:  Whether you opposite counterbuilt (e.g., bought an
   atlas vs. no speed hitting, or armor vs. double CP)
 * Petal can praise you for when you did it, or didn't need to
 * Krul can criticize you for when you didn't do it, but needed to
 * Krul can really criticize you for opposite counterbuilding

## Extend professors Petal and Krul with rotation information

 * Or optionally make this an entirely new professor
 * New routine needed:  How many times you rotated when you should have,
   and how many times you failed to rotate when you should have rotated
 * Petal can praise you for high % of siezing rotation opportunities
 * Krul can criticize you for a low % of them

## New professor: Flicker

 * Topic: vision
 * Unfortunately, many of these are not yet possible with the telemetry data
   we have now, so Flicker is on indefinite hold.  When the data is
   available, I'd like to do this with it:
 * Average number of traps on map at once (all these are compared across
   all teams at your skill tier)
 * Percent of the time someone on your team possessed flares, gun, or
   contraption
 * Average number of traps in the enemy's side of the map at once
 * Number of flares fired
 * Number of flares that revealed enemies or traps
