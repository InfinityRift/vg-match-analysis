# Plans for the future of this project

Here's a list of things I'd like to add to this project.  I can't add any
more before
[the challenge deadline](https://developer.vainglorygame.com/rules),
but this is just thinking ahead in case I play with this project more after
the deadline.

## Bug report

 * Visual glitches on some devices, [as shown in this
   tweet](https://twitter.com/VGsenlark/status/850185258158800897/photo/1)

## Quality of Life/UX Improvements

 * Create a new university on [Rate My
   Professors](http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/) and add all the faculty.
   Then add links from each of their output to go complain/brag about grades
   you got from them.

## Quality of code improvements

 * Factor all the JS out of the HTML pages into sensible modules.
 * Consider rewriting it as CS code, and adding a build process that
   compiles it, so the whole codebase is documented and readable on GitHub.

## New professor: Lyra

 * Topic: Team composition and drafting
    * List all positive synergies in your team and counters against enemies
    * List all snyergies on enemy team and their counters to your team
 * New data required, which I just won't have time to get before the
   challenge ends:
    * A list of which heroes work well or poorly into which other heroes,
      and why
    * A list of which heroes synergize well or poorly with other heroes,
      and why.
 * So Lyra is on hold for now.

## New professor: Skaarf

 * His quote will be dragon onomatopoeia only.  His advice will be gestures
   that are explained in plain text, since he can't actually say anything.
 * New routine needed:  How many times you rotated when you should have,
   and how many times you failed to rotate when you should have rotated

## Extend professor Flicker

 * Unfortunately, many of these are not yet possible with the telemetry data
   we have now, so Flicker is on indefinite hold.  When the data is
   available, I'd like to do this with it:
 * Average number of traps on map at once (all these are compared across
   all teams at your skill tier)
 * Average number of traps in the enemy's side of the map at once
 * Number of flares fired
 * Number of flares that revealed enemies or traps
